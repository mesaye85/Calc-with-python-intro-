Age Calculation
The age calculation is based on the year of birth entered by the user. It subtracts the current year (2020) from the year of birth to calculate the age. Note that the result may not be accurate as it does not take into account the month and day of birth.

Error Handling
The calculator includes error handling for division by zero. If the user attempts to divide by zero, a message will be displayed in the terminal warning against dividing by zero.-with-python-intro-
